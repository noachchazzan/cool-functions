//Alright, let's provide a lesson that touches on the core concepts of "Pass by Value" and "Pass by Reference" with a touch of humor, keeping in mind the persona of Linus and his intelligent granddaughter.
// ========================
// INTRODUCTION BY GRANDPA LINUS
// ========================
/*
Hey there, kiddo!
I've seen you conquer challenges, from the complexities of life to the intricacies of your... let's say, 
"personal adventures". ðŸ˜‰ Now, I've got a challenge for you that's close to my heart: diving into the world of JavaScript and understanding some of its quirks. 
You're a smart cookie, so I know you'll get the hang of this: "Pass by Value" and "Pass by Reference". Let's get started!

// ========================
// THE PLAYERS IN OUR DRAMA
// ========================
// Meet Timmy and Julie. Think of them as symbols representing data.

// ========================
// THE ART OF MOVING: moveLocation
// ========================
/* 
Much like in life, data sometimes needs to move and change. 
Let's create a function that lets our characters change their location. 
Your task: Craft a function named moveLocation().*/

// SHARING MEMORIES: Living Together
// ========================

Timmy and Julie are getting close, real close. So close that they want to share their memories 
(or locations). Let's make that connection.
Your task: Create a bond between Timmy and Julie's location. */

After sharing so many memories, a new character emerges in our story. 
Let's introduce personThree. Your task: Define personThree with some unique attributes.*/

// FINDING ONE'S PATH: Independence

// As stories evolve, characters seek their own paths. 
// Help personThree find their own memories, distinct from the others.
// Your task: Let personThree chart their own course.

// THE FUTURE: Cloning Era
// ========================

Your task: Design a  clonePerson() function.

    // To address deep copies then nested objects are also copied via '...'

// CONNECTING SOULS: The Hive Mind
// ========================
/*
In a world where thoughts can be shared, let's link our characters in a web of shared memories.
