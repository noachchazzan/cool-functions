//Alright, let's provide a lesson that touches on the core concepts of "Pass by Value" and "Pass by Reference" with a touch of humor, keeping in mind the persona of Linus and his intelligent granddaughter.

// ========================
// INTRODUCTION BY GRANDPA LINUS
// ========================
/*
Hey there, kiddo!

I've seen you conquer challenges, from the complexities of life to the intricacies of your... let's say, "personal adventures". ðŸ˜‰ Now, I've got a challenge for you that's close to my heart: diving into the world of JavaScript and understanding some of its quirks. 

You're a smart cookie, so I know you'll get the hang of this: "Pass by Value" and "Pass by Reference". Let's get started!

// ========================
// THE PLAYERS IN OUR DRAMA
// ========================

// Meet Timmy and Julie. Think of them as symbols representing data.
const personOne = {
    name: { first: 'Timmy', last: 'Timtim' },
    age: 30,
    location: { city: 'New York', state: 'New York', zip: 10001 }
};

const personTwo = {
    name: { first: 'Julie', last: 'July' },
    age: 28,
    location: { city: 'Albany', state: 'New York', zip: 12201 }
};

// ========================
// THE ART OF MOVING: moveLocation
// ========================
/* 
Much like in life, data sometimes needs to move and change. Let's create a function that lets our characters change their location. 

Your task: Craft a function named moveLocation().
*/

// TODO: Code the moveLocation function here.

// ========================
// SHARING MEMORIES: Living Together
// ========================
/*
Timmy and Julie are getting close, real close. So close that they want to share their memories (or locations). Let's make that connection.

Your task: Create a bond between Timmy and Julie's location.
*/

// TODO: Link their locations.

// ========================
// A NEW BEGINNING: The Birth of personThree
// ========================
/*
After sharing so many memories, a new character emerges in our story. Let's introduce personThree.

Your task: Define personThree with some unique attributes.
*/

// TODO: Introduce personThree.

// ========================
// FINDING ONE'S PATH: Independence
// ========================
/*
// As stories evolve, characters seek their own paths. Help personThree find their own memories, distinct from the others.

//Your task: Let personThree chart their own course.
*/

// TODO: Help personThree find independence.

// ========================
// THE FUTURE: Cloning Era
// ========================
/*
In this digital age, cloning isn't just sci-fi. Let's duplicate our characters and see how they interact.

Your task: Design a  clonePerson() function.
*/

// TODO: Craft the cloning mechanism!

// ========================
// CONNECTING SOULS: The Hive Mind
// ========================
/*
In a world where thoughts can be shared, let's link our characters in a web of shared memories.

Your task: Design a structure where memories (or thoughts) are shared.
*/

// TODO: Create the shared realm of thoughts.
